# C++ OpenGL Game Engine
This work was done during the final year of my degree, during the first semester everyone would build the foundations of the engine, logging, time keeping, windows, OpenGL Abstraction, events, layers, and the entity component system. Then at the start of the second semester we were put into groups and had to pick somebody’s engine to build upon, my engine was chosen as I had completed most of the work from the previous semester and it was of higher quality. Each member of the team would then work on an individual project(s).

# Lecturer Feedback
* Our Lecturer was impressed by parts of the project and overall was happy with the team’s performance.
* My individual score was 73%, the highest in the group, the next highest was 65% and the lowest was 60%
* In the presentation for the engine our lecturer noted that 64% of the commits for the project since the start of the semester (when the group work began) were mine, there were five members in the group

# My Individual projects were:
* Particle System & Particle Component
* Particle Editor Tool
* Uniform Buffers
* Improving Shader Support (Geometry & Tessellation)
* INI Start-up file
* Observer Pattern Interface

# I was also heavily involved in these improvements, but these were done with other team members
* ASSIMP Model Loader
* 3D Physics using ReactPhysics3D
# Engine Features - 1st Semester
* Logging using SPD Log
* Time keeping using Chrono
* Events
* Abstracted OpenGL
* 3D and 2D Rendering
* Parsing of Single File Shaders (Vertex Buffer Layout, Uniforms Locations, Uniform Buffers)
* Layer Stack
* Entity Component System / Game Objects

# Engine Features - 2nd Semester
* Basic Profiler
* Particle System
* Uniform Buffers
* INI start-up file
* Observer Pattern Interface
* 3D Physics using ReactPhysics3D
* Model Loading using ASSIMP
* ImGui Integration
