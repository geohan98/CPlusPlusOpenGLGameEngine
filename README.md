# C++ OpenGL Game Engine
This work was done during the final year of my degree, during the first semester everyone would build the foundations of the engine, logging, time keeping, windows, OpenGL Abstraction, events, layers, and the entity component system. Then at the start of the seccond semester we were put into groups and had to pick sombodies engine to build upon, my engine was chosen as I had compleated most of the work from the previous semeseter and it was of higher quality. Each member of the team would then work on an induvudual project(s).

# My Inducidual projects were:
* Particle System & Particle Compomnent
* Particle Editor Tool
* Uniform Buffers
* Improving Shader Support (Geomerety & Tesselation)
* INI Startup file
* Observer Pattern Interface
# I was also heavily invloved in these improvements but these were done with other team members
* Assimp Model Loader
* 3D Physics using ReactPhysics3D
# Engine Features - 1st Semester
* Logging using SPD Log
* Time keeping using Chrono
* Events
* Abstracted OpenGL
* 3D and 2D Rendering
* Parsing Of Single File Shaders (Vertex Buffer Layout, Uniforms Locations, Uniform Buffers)
* Layer Stack
* Enitiy Component System / Game Objects
# Engine Features - 2nd Semester
* Basic Profiler
* Particle System
* Uniform Buffers
* INI startup file
* Observer Pattern Interface
* 3D Physics using ReactPhysics3D
* Model Loading using Assimp
* ImGui Intergration
* Fmod Audio
# Uninished features due to time or other constraints
* Text Rendering
* UI System
